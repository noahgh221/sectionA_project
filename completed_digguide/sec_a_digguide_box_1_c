folder 1	1		Abolitionist speech	circa 1850	1850/1850	eng	1 item		"Anonymous manuscript text of abolitionist speech. The author criticized the American Colonization Society; addressed the issue of compensation of slaveholders for the price of slaves; condemned churches condoning slavery; and stated that interracial sexual relations were the product of slavery. Issues raised appear to concern the Fugitive Slave Law of 1850, particularly the author's anger over the imprisonment of fugitive slaves without trial and the requirement that citizens assist in the return of fugitive slaves."
