         <abstract>Nine letters written by Bridges to Annie describing his life in South Africa. Primary topics include lifestyle and culture; his financial difficulties, especially because of gambling and business loss; news from home; his recommendations for improving Annie's health; the weather; religion; and marriage. In addition, several letters discuss the buildup to and outbreak of the Anglo-Boer War. Earlier letters (1894-1897) predict war and mention some of the political circumstances that led to tension between the English and the Boers/Afrikaners. A later letter (1900) describes the outbreak of war and his own involvement in it, including being forced to leave Johannesburg and then volunteering for the British army ambulance corps. Includes 9 envelopes.</abstract>
