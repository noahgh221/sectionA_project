         <abstract>This collection contains five letters. Four are from brothers Henry and William Hukill to other relatives back home in Steubenville, Ohio. Two of these letters are written in New Orleans and two in Natchez where the Hukills have gone to work. The other letter is from Thirza Hukill in Steubenville to her husband Henry. The Hukills made several trips from Ohio to work in La. and Miss. The topics covered include family, health, and money matters. Economic conditions in both Natchez and New Orleans are discussed, and a brief comparison is made between wages in New Orleans, Steubenville, and Natchez. However, neither Henry nor William's occupation is stated. Henry mentions the specific wage rate in Natchez. He also discusses the costs of various food items and whiskey in Natchez. There is also a general description of the climate in New Orleans.</abstract>
