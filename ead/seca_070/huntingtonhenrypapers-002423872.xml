         <abstract>Collection includes letters appealing for financial support from Huntington for the American Colonization Society, most of them from Rev. Alexander Moncrief Proudfit, Corresponding Secretary of the New York Chapter of the Society. Huntington writes of the schism in churches between supporters of the colonization movement and some who feel the Society is a proslavery organization. Proudfit writes about the work that Huntington's money is going toward, such as transportation for the Governor of Liberia to sail from colony to colony. Enclosed in one of Proudfit's letters is a circular with a letter from Samuel Benedict, who had migrated from Georgia to Liberia. Proudfit appeals for money in other letters and he also includes another letter from a former slave. One circular letter is from Nathaniel Shatswell Dodge, Agent of the American Colonization Society. The collection holds a great deal of information on the work of the Society in Liberia. Two clippings are also included.</abstract>
