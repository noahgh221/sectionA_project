         <abstract>Collection consists of a diary of Elliott and loose items. Brief diary entries give an account of Elliott's voyage in 1849 from England to India and his service there. Entries beginning in 1852 describe the Second Burmese War: the taking of Martaban and Prome and the pursuit of the Burmese. Entries beginning in 1854 chiefly detail conditions in the Crimea at the end of the Crimean War.In 1856 Elliott recounted his travels in the Crimea with a party of British officers before embarking for England on June 20. Included are the names and regiment of those with whom he came into contact and those who were killed or wounded, but there are gaps in entries. Loose items, and a few diary pages, pertain to ciphers and codes. Included is a 1852 pencil drawing of the Shouey Dagon Pagoda.</abstract>
