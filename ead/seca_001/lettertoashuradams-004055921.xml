         <abstract>Collection comprises a letter written to Ashur Adams in Boston. The letter was composed during the writer's stay in western North Carolina, and was mostly likely written by Adams' son, George Wyllis Adams. The primary topic of the letter is description of the Blue Ridge mountains, including the people ("It would surprise you to hear dueling talked of as a matter of course in quarrels, yet it is fairly a feature of this country[,] I believe &amp; a vast no. of people wear arms of some sort."), roads, and landscape. The letter also contains a sketch of the landscape. Other topics include horseback riding, the writer's slight illness, and his concern about the lack of correspondence from family members ("I have been obliged to become quite sociable with my neighbors merely because I am encouraged to talk on paper with none of you.)"</abstract>
