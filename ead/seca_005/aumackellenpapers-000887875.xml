         <abstract>Collection consists primarily of Civil War letters to Ellen Aumack from Sergeant Young J. Powell of Company K, 2nd Regiment, Iowa Infantry Veteran Volunteers. Powell's first three letters were written from Tennessee, where he had been separated from his regiment. He wintered there and reports news about Sherman's army. Two letters then written from Goldsboro and Raleigh, N.C., after Powell had rejoined his regiment. He wrote about the ending of the Civil War, with topics including General Sherman's army, the surrender of General Johnston, and Abraham Lincoln's assassination. Following the war, Powell wrote from Washington, D.C., discussing troop movements and reviews. The collection includes one letter from Aumack to Powell, as well as his discharge certificate.</abstract>
