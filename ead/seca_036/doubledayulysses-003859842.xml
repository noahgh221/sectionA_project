         <p>Ulysses Doubleday was a U.S. Army officer, Colonel of the 3rd and 45th U.S. Colored Troops, and a member of the New York Stock Exchange. He was the son of Ulysses F. Doubleday, a congressman; and the brother of Abner Doubleday, a general in the Union Army who, at one time, was credited as the inventor of baseball, a claim that was later disputed.</p>
