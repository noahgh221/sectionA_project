         <abstract>Letters written by young soldier from Oregon during World War I. Most of the letters were written from training camp prior to his service overseas, but a few mention his experiences in the trenches. In many of the letters he expresses his love and longing for his family as well as his patriotism. A few letters were written after the end of the war when Bonney was a member of a traveling theatrical troupe.</abstract>
