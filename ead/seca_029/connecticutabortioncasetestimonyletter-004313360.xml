         <abstract>Collection comprises a letter from "C.H.H" to a colleague, regarding an ongoing Conn. trial in an abortion case involving "Mrs. Green," "Gen. Walker," and "Mr. Mitchell." Abortion was legal in Conn. until 1821, when it became the first state to explicitly outlaw the practice. The text includes: "Mrs. Green began to testify on Friday night--but was taken sick &amp; had to be sent home. That she was really sick, there can be no doubt. But whether it was the journey &amp;c. or agitation &amp; excitement as to what she was required to testify--is still a mystery. I want you to send me her history &amp; that of her family ... so as to shape our cross examination.... She is expected to testify that the abortion matter was all gotten up by Genl W--without there being any truth in it--She began by saying that Genl W. called on her at Naugatuck [Conn.].... Then [abbr. "said"?] that Gen Walker had been speaking ill of his daughter &amp; also one of hers. That he Walker had [abbr. "said"?] that he had given medicine to produce abortion....They are going to destroy Genl W's testimony--by all kinds of evidence contradicting him--if they possibly can."</abstract>
