         <abstract>This collection is comprised of letters addressed by Jacob, Edward J., and Solomon Saylor to their sister, Sarah, while they served in the Union Army. Also included is a biographical sketch of Jacob completed by his granddaughter, Annabelle Saylor. Edward and Solomon Saylor enlisted in the 36th regiment of the Ohio Volunteer Militia in 1861. Jacob attempted to enlist with his brothers, but an Uncle retreived him from the regiment--he was only fifteen years old. Despite his age, later that year Jacob successfully enlisted in the 53rd Ohio Infantry. All the brothers' letters contain descriptions of camp life, military engagements, reported losses in both armies for battles, hardships, and their desire for furloughs. Jacob's correspondence suggests that he did much more hard marching and fighting than his brothers; however, Edward's letters mention that Solomon was wounded and probably taken prisoner twice. Jacob also writes about the formation of the Tennessee Colored Zouave Regiment, which African Americans were eager to volunteer to join. Jacob eventually served in Sherman's Army, and fought in Tennessee, Mississippi, Alabama, and Georgia; Edward and Solomon fought mainly in Virginia and Tennessee.</abstract>
