         <abstract>Chiefly letters from Adeline Harlow to family members in Cambridge, Massachusetts. The author described the faculty, students, and local surroundings of Limestone Springs Female High School. Other topics include sermons and illnesses, particularly whooping cough and congestive fever. Ms. Harlow reflected on her home, family and friends in Massachusetts, and condemned a female acquaintance who was apparently an alcoholic. She expressed her belief that wages were better in the South and her desire to live independently. One letter contains a drawing of the floorplan of Limestone Springs Female High School. Collection includes two letters to Dr. F.F. Harlow of Cambridge, one from a friend requesting a favor and one from the Berkshire Medical Institution regarding the loss of a building by fire.</abstract>
