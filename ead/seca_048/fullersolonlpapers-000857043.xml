         <abstract>Collection consists of correspondence to and from Fuller during the Civil War. Letters are primarily between Solon and Elizabeth Fuller; also writing are Sidney and John Fuller, their sons (also enlisted in the Confederate Army). Elizabeth Fuller occasionally forwarded Sidney's letters to Solon with her own added notes, as well as some annotations by their granddaughter, Caldonia. Elizabeth's letters describe her feeling abandoned by Solon; she lacks food, money, and materials to sustain the farm. Solon's letters apologize to her, and include suggestions and discussions of food shortages, prices of supplies and cloth, and his attempts to obtain a furlough. The exact location of the family's farm is unclear; Elizabeth directs Solon to send letters to Chulafinnee, Alabama.</abstract>
