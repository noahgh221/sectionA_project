         <abstract>Collection contains three letters, the first of which is by Furman from Montgomery, Ala., to his sister, Maria in Charleston. He reports on his journey towards New Orleans and describes the towns he has seen. He negatively contrasts Milledgeville, Ga. with Macon. He also mentions travelling the Creek Nation, and comments that he saw mainly white people along the road. The second letter is to Furman from his brother J.B., a farmer in Darlington, S.C.J.B. Furman writes of his interest in silk farming, sericulture and planting mulberry trees. The third letter is from another brother, H.H. Furman, to Maria. H.H. Furman was apparently struggling in business in New Orleans and writes of a cousin who died following amputation of a broken leg.</abstract>
