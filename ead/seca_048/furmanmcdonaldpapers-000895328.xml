         <abstract>Family and business correspondence of McDonald Furman, largely from his aunt "Ann" and from Mrs. D. Eli Dunlap, a teacher in the Presbyterian Mission School established for the Catawba Indians in York County, S.C. Included are political comments and references to Clemson College (now Clemson University), S.C., and Richard Furman's writings. Also, among the undated material, are a biographical sketch of Richard Furman and a long genealogical chart showing the connections of the Furman family.Included also is an unusual account book for Cornhill Plantation in Sumter District, apparently kept by John Blount Miller from its beginning in 1827 until about 1860, when it was evidently taken over by his son-in-law, Dr. John H. Furman. The plantation book includes many different types of records: receipts; expenditures; marriages, births and deaths of slaves; weekly rations and clothing issued to slaves; domestic animals on the plantation; corn, cotton, and other crops produced; illnesses, deaths and visits of members of the family; land owned and inventories of tools; rules for governing slaves; accounts of unusual weather; and lists of keys.In the latter portion of the account book, kept by John H. Furman, there are many records of contracts with freedmen, and accounts of money and goods advanced to them.</abstract>
