         <abstract>Collection consists of a volume that has 105 pages of diary entries and 16 pages of financial accounts. The diary begins when the ship is in Cuba after starting it's journey in Philadelphia. Hathorn records more information about her domestic life than about her husband, but she presents a clear and detailed description of what daily life was like for the wife of a commercial sailing captain. She also describes how the ship was left in Savannah, Georgia, when she and her husband visited friends in Maine. She remained with her family when the ship was sold and gave birth to a daughter. The remainder of the volume contains a list of expenses.</abstract>
