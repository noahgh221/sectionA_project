         <abstract>Collection consists of two letters and an address by James Garber. The first letter concerns the purchase of land by a member of the Garber family; the second was written by Garber while he was a Confederate soldier, about the treatment of his horses while he was absent from the regiment. The address, "The Doctor and His Office," was delivered by Garber to the Birmingham Baptist Hospital. It is a philosophical treatment of the role and responsibilities of physicians to society.</abstract>
