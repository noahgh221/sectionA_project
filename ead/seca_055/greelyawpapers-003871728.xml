         <abstract>Collection consists mainly of letters sent from Greely to his brother, John Augustus Greely, and to his likely brother-in-law, John W. Winder. The letters date from three periods: 1863-1866, 1888-1890, and 1903-1909. The earliest letters pertain to Greely's obtaining a position in a regiment of the 81st U.S. Colored Infantry, which participated in the Seige of Port Hudson, Louisiana and was transferred to New Orleans following the Civil War. Greely describes the political events leading up to the New Orleans Massacre (New Orleans Race Riot) of 1866, his unit's role in the conflict, and the impact that the conflict had on his career trajectory. Letters from later periods are more routine, mostly discussing visits to Newburyport as well as financial and legal matters. There are a few letters related to his duties in San Francisco in 1906.</abstract>
