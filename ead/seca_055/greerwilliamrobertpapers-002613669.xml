         <abstract>Typescript memoir (32 pp.) of Greer's Civil War experiences, entitled "Recollections of a Private Soldier of the Army of the Confederate States." The memoir's best descriptions involving actual combat include observations at Cold Harbor, and an anecdote concerning Greer's capture of a Union cavalry officer during the siege of Petersburg. His writing also conveys a fair sense of what life in Charleston was like during and immediately before the war. Greer also discusses the hardships endured by the men taken at Ft. Fisher and confined at Elmira, N.Y., particularly those which pertain to medical and sanitary affairs. Greer notes that pneumonia, typhoid, and smallpox spread rapidly though the prison despite honest efforts of federal authorities to contain disease. The memoir was probably written after 1921. Researchers may also wish to consult the pamphlet ROLLS OF THE WASHINGTON LIGHT INFANTRY, which lists the peronnel of all three active service companies of that organization.</abstract>
