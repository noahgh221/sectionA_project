         <abstract>The author, who was related to the Carslake family, travelled in Devon, Cornwall, and Wast Sussex as a companion to her invalid uncle. Journal entries provide reports on the uncle's condition; accounts of letters and visits from family and friends; and descriptions of flora, landscapes, and architecture she saw on her frequent walks. Occasionally the author expressed her extreme dissatisfaction with the constraints of her daily routine. Some entries include descriptions of folk customs witnessed during her travels. No journal entries occur between May 13, 1863 and June 24, 1867. The other item in the collection is an undated manuscript poem entitled, "Bruce's Epitath."</abstract>
