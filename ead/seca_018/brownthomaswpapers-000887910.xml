         <abstract>Collection consists of letters sent by Brown to his family after he was captured in late spring 1862. Letters, subjected to censorship, described his life in Union prisons at Fort Columbus, Governor's Island, N.Y., and at Johnson's Island, Sandusky, Ohio, and expressing hope for a prisoner exchange. Brown described his treatment by Union captors as mild and humane. By Aug. 31, 1862, he wrote his sister that he was traveling south by way of Vicksburg and the Mississippi River; presumably he had been freed by this point.</abstract>
