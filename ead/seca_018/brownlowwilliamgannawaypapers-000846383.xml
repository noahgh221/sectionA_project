         <abstract>Two letters concern arrangements for lectures in the North while Brownlow was a fugitive from Tennessee during the early years of the Civil War. The other two letters were written while Brownlow served as Reconstruction governor of Tennessee, 1865-1866. The first letter from 1865 Apr. 26 states Brownlow's inability to help with rents, debts, prisoners, and other post-war concerns. A second letter from 1866 Jul. 7 is from Brownlow to Chief Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court, Salmon P. Chase, comments on the upcoming vote on an amendment in Congress (likely the 14th amendment) and the fact that the president was working for its defeat.</abstract>
