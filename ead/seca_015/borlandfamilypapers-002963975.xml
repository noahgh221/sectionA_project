         <abstract>This collection contains papers for three generations of the Borland family. Thomas Borland was a doctor at Fort Johnson near Charleston, South Carolina, at least from 1806 to 1808. He also served as a surgeon's mate in the U.S. Army from 6 March-1 April 1808. The four letters written to Thomas in the collection include one from a personal friend; one from Thomas T. Tucker, the Treasurer of the U.S.; and two written in 1832 by Euclid Borland, Thomas' son. Euclid served as a doctor in the U.S. Navy's ship JOHN ADAMS. His letters discuss cholera, Italy, the ship MARSEILLES, and his desire to return home. Other items in the collection include a handwritten record of the Confedrate Army career of Euclid Borland, Jr., who served in the 6th Virginia Infantry Regiment, as well as his passport, dated 1867.</abstract>
