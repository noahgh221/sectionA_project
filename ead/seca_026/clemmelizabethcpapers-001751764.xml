         <abstract>Two of the three letters comprising this collection were written to Elizabeth C. Clemm by her mother from London. The letters are travelogues that include descriptions of what she and her party are seeing and experiencing. Her comments include her view of the British, impression of Nicolo Paganini, one of whose concerts she attended, and a detailed description of a flea circus. It appears that the young lady Sophia in her party was perhaps her daughter and that she may have been seeking a husband for her among British aristocracy. The young boy in the group seems to have been her son. Among the others in Mrs. Clemm's coterie was one Hamilton, the author of the third letter of which there is only a fragment.</abstract>
