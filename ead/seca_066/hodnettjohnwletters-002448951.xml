         <head>Historical Note</head>
         <p>John W. Hodnett was a Confederate soldier in the 13th Regiment of the Georgia Volunteers. He was a resident of Meriwether County, Georgia. There are several John Hodnetts from that county, so it is difficult to provide more information about him. T. J. Hodnett was born in 1845 in Henry, Georgia, and also served in the same regiment. The relationship between these two men is unclear.</p>
