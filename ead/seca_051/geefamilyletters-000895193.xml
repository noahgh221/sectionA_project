         <abstract>Collection comprises business and legal correspondence of Sterling, Nevill, Charles, and Joseph Gee, although Nevill Gee has greatest prominence. Joseph Gee was extensively engaged in cotton planting. Nevill also owned one or more plantations in Alabama, which Joseph supervised. In November 1824, Joseph Gee died suddenly, leaving a large estate (including 47 slaves) intestate. Nevill's son, Sterling, immediately went to Alabama to supervise his father's plantations and administer his uncle's estate. The early letters refer to the business devolving from these circumstances. Sterling apparently remained in Alabama for an indefinite period, looking after his family's interests, and engaging in his own land speculation. Sterling's brother Charles also resided in Alabama, where at one time he worked as a school teacher. The latter letters deal almost entirely with business matters and law suits. Other topics include early settlement in Alabama; prices for slaves, land, cotton, crops; and the local economic structure.</abstract>
