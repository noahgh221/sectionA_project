         <abstract>Latin manuscript gives the views of Sir. Dr. Hennebel on the idea of grace during the Jansenist controversy. The general subject of the manuscript is grace in the theological sense, and what God's grace does, as against what man's works might do, grace as a ground of salvation, and grace achieved by following God's command. The writer is evidently against the grounds for which the "five propositions" of the Janesists were condemned by Pope Innocent X in 1653.</abstract>
