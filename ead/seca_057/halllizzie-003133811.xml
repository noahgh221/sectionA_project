         <abstract>Holograph commencement address entitled "A Glance at the Past and a Peep into the Future" delivered at Louisville Female College on June 8th, 1871. Hall challenged her fellow students to diligently continue their studies, with "Shall we improve the little learning we have acquired or shall we neglect and bury it? Shall we waste our precious moments in the gay amusements of fashionable society, or cast our books from sight because domestic duties, and social intercourse demand our attention?" Hall warned that studying may help the graduates to avoid possible undefined and threatening "dark futures," as well as the mistakes made by great nations in the past. Acquired as part of the Sallie Bingham Center for Women's History and Culture. (02-114).</abstract>
