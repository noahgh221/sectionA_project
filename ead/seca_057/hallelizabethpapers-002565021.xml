         <abstract>Collection consists of miscellaneous letters concerning the Civil War, containing one letter from Libbie Hall and several others in which she is mentioned. Two letters were written by J. M. Stroud to his brother and sister. Stroud discourages his sister Sarah from visiting the Army camps, believing them unfit for a lady. He also advised his brother to not enlist, writing that the Army had as many men as it needed. Stroud describes the Battle of Richmond and subsequent retreat of the Army to Washington, and comments that if Sec. of War Stanton had allowed General McClellan enough troops, Richmond would have been captured in 1862.</abstract>
