         <abstract>The collection consists of miscellaneous correspondence, primarily dating from the 1880s while Halderman was in the diplomatic service of the United States. A variety of matters are discussed, but content is largely personal with little mention of Halderman's diplomatic work. Correspondence is comprised of invitations, requests for consort's cards, and introductions. There are a few Civil War letters and an 1857 letter concerning a legal matter. Correspondents include congressmen, authors, and diplomats.</abstract>
