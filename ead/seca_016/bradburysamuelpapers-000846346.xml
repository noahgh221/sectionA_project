         <abstract>Chiefly letters to Bradbury, in Connecticut, from Andrew Jackson Crossley, who served with the U.S. Engineers in the Army of the Potomac. Crossley's letters describe the work of the engineers -- particularly construction of artillery emplacements and fortifications of railroad bridges -- as well as military activities, low morale, disputes between officers and enlisted men, his hatred for military camp life, and his dislike of African American troops. He also includes descriptions of camp life, including musicals and plays presented by different troops, as well as military court martials and executions.</abstract>
