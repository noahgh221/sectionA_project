         <abstract>Letterpress book and letters dealing with business matters. Much of the early correspondence concerns Burton's efforts to secure remuneration from either the British or American governments, or from private manufacturers in both countries, for their use of his process of manufacturing steel gun barrels. Included are references to labor conditions in England and the business affairs of various English and American armament companies. The bulk of the material after 1873, when Burton emigrated to America, concerns the management of his farm, including orders for supplies, receipts, sales of stock and produce, and sales and purchases of land in Virginia, West Virginia, and Georgia.</abstract>
