         <abstract>Miscellaneous family papers, including letters, Henry Burrow's will, as well as various deeds and financial papers regarding Elizabeth Burrow's management of her husband Henry's estate. Henry Burrow served in the Civil War and died in a Richmond hospital around 1863 as a result of his injuries. Included are three letters he posted to his wife from the hospital and a fragment of the letter sent to Elizabeth informing her of his death. The collection also contains an advertising booklet published by Ford Motor Company (1912); undated obituaries for several Thomasville citizens; a copy of a Thomasville Chair Company newsletter, THE CHAIRMAKER (June 1924); and miscellaneous and financial papers for the Ragan family.</abstract>
