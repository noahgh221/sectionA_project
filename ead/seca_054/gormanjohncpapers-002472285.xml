         <abstract>Collection contains a manuscript diary-memoir about his imprisonment, a three-page description of Fort Delaware and its prisoners, and a typescript (63 pp.) of these two items. Experiences in the diary seem to have been written soon after the events occurred. There is an account of the Battle of Spotsylvania, and Gorman tells of his capture, the trip to Old Capitol Prison in Washington, D.C., his incarceration at Fort Delaware Prison, and at a hospital at Beaufort, S.C. on Port Royal Island. He takes particular note of the relations between the whites and African-Americans on the island, as well as disparaging rumors about Northern women schoolteachers.
