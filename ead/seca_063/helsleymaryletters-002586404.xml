         <abstract>This collection is comprised of William J. Helsley's letters to his wife while serving in the Civil War. Helsley's letters describe conditions in his company's camps near Chattanooga, Nashville, New Orleans, and Green Lake, Tex., and reveal much uncertainty about where his company will move next. While in New Orleans, he writes of visiting two sugar plantations, and of having received the impression that Louisiana planters had largely turned from producing sugar cane to growing corn and cotton. He also tells of having seen some production of lemons, oranges, and figs. In another letter, he writes of four divisions of African American troops being sent to Texas.</abstract>
