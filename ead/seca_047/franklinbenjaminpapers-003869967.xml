         <p>Collection includes a copy of a letter from Benjamin Franklin written on behalf of the abolition society of Pennsylvania to John Langdon, President of New Hampshire, stating that enslaved people were brought into the southern states in ships owned by residents of New Hampshire, and hoping that Langdon will put a stop to this practice.</p>
         <p>Collection includes a letter of introduction for two young men named Mitford written by Richard Price. Price states that a great revolution has taken place in England, and that he hopes that those now in positions of Influence within the Government will prove themselves to be friends of liberty and justice, and that the war between England and the Colonies will soon be terminated.</p>
         <p>Collection includes a print of the printing press at which Benjamin Franklin first worked as a journeyman with attached letters verifying that this press is the one at which Franklin first worked; a receipt of March 24, 1757, from Franklin to John Hughes for his gift of thirty-two dollars to the Society for Promoting Arts and Manufactures, and for eight dollars to be spent by Franklin for a thermometer and barometer.
