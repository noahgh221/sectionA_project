         <p>The collection was passed by descent to the 16th Conde de Altamira. The papers were sold
            by Altamira in about 1865 and were bought from a French bookseller by Sir Thomas
            Phillipps in 1870. They were sold at Sotheby's on June 26th 1973. Duke purchased the
            collection in 1981 from Quevedo Rare Books and Manuscript of London. Most of the items
            still retain their Phillipps catalog numbers.</p>
