         <abstract>Collection contains the records of the firm of Terrasson Brothers, established in
            Philadelphia by Antoine and Barthelemy Terrasson as a branch of their father's firm,
            John Terrasson and Company, headquartered in Paris and Lyons, France. Early business
            letters reflect the trade of the firm in grain, the furnishings of supplies to the
            French and American armies, and the purchase of tobacco at various places throughout the
            South. The letters contain information on the American Revolution, especially on naval
            operations, and on post-Revolutionary business conditions. Papers after 1800 concern the
            family of Mark Prager, members of which apparently married into the Terrasson family.
            Prager was owner of a trading firm in Holland. These papers contain information on
            Prager's trading activities until 1820, and on the family of Harriet Prager of
            Philadelphia. The later letters contain references to family affairs, slavery, politics
            and sectionalism. Approximately 100 Civil War letters describe conditions in the
            North.</abstract>

         <head>Historical Note</head>
         <p>Terrasson Brothers was a trading firm established in Philadelphia by brothers Antoine
            and Barthelemy Terrason sometime around the American Revolution. The firm was likely and
            outgrowth of their father's firm, John Terrasson and Company, of Paris and Lyons,
            France. Initially the firm seems to have speculated in grain, furnished supplies to the
            French and American armies, and bought tobacco. The firm owned trading vessels. The
            Terrassons were likely friends of Albert Gallatin.</p>
