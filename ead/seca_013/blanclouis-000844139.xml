         <abstract>Manuscript of an article attacking the May Law, a restrictive French election law of 1850 that deprived 3 of the 10 million possible voters of their eligibility. The electoral reform comission was appointed on May 1; a week later the draft measure was introduced in the National Assembly and was revised and passed. The new law went into effect on May 31. Blanc's article, "La Situation," attacked the proposed law. This manuscript is dated May 15, 1850, and was apparently intended for publication in "Le Nouveau Monde," but a note on the article's last page indicates that the printer has refused to print it. The May 15 issue of "Le Nouveau Monde" mentions Blanc's missing article; this manuscript appears to be that deleted article.</abstract>
