         <abstract>Collection consists of letters between the Boardman family. The earliest letters are between Volney and his daughter Margaret, who was attending an academy between 1850 and 1860; they concern her education and the family's financial hardship following a drought and failed crops. Civil War letters of James L. Boardman, 5th Alabama Regiment, C.S.A., and of his brother, Henry, 62nd Alabama Regiment, C.S.A., describe camp life, supplies, capture and imprisonment by the Yankees, military campaigns, and the destruction of the Harper's Ferry and Winchester Railroad. Letters following the war largely detail family affairs, with one letter mentioning the activities of the Ku Klux Klan.</abstract>
