         <abstract>European travel diary, 1876, which includes a few lists of travel expenses, and a page of financial information, 1882. Entries often contain reports on activities, mail received, people visited, and information received from others. The diary reflects the typical social life of a wealthy American travelling abroad during the nineteenth century.Dumaresq's travels took him to London and then to Scotland, particularly Melrose and Dryburgh Abbey. In Edinburgh he described the two occasions on which he saw Queen Victoria. In Switzerland Dumaresq visited Velvey, Geneva, Lucerne, Berne, Lausanne, and his stops in France included Rouen, Strasbourg, and Metz. He met a young Englishman who told him about encounters with Empress Eugénie. At the end of his trip, he returned to England, where he visited London, Canterbury, Brighton, Windsor Castle, Oxford, Stratford-on-Avon, Manchester, and Liverpool, where he saw the Duke and Duchess of Westminster.</abstract>
