She frequently related anecdotes about dignitaries and celebrities, including the Empress Josephine, King George III, Marie Antoinette, Mary Wollstonecraft, Hannah More, Charlotte Turner Smith, Sarah Siddons, Reverend Rowland Hill, Dr. Thomas Beddoes, and Abbe Augustin Barruel. Lady Coffin-Greenly commented on customs and conditions in countries to which her friends traveled, including Turkey, Ireland, and France. She also wrote of new discoveries in medicine, including vaccination and nitrous oxide; of the merchant ships known as Indiamen; of the excavation of the Roman villa in Woodchester, Gloucestershire; and of the living condition of the emigres in England. Some of the later entries were written in retrospect. In addition to diary entries, she appears to have copied letters she received from family and friends. In 1811, the author married Sir Isaac Coffin, who added her family name to his, but later relinquished it.In 1811, the author married Sir Isaac Coffin, who added her family name to his, but later relinquished it.</abstract>
