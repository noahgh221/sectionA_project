         <abstract>Collection contains a variety of items including a number of Civil War period letters between J.J. Davis and his wife E.J., whom he addresses as Betty. Neither knew the English language well, but their letters are quite informative about her home life and his service. They were both very religious and appear to have had deep respect and affection for one another. His first letter gives Gainesville, Ala. as the post office and another was written after a retreat near Baldwin, Miss. Ms. Davis' family owned slaves and there is some mention of the hiring and selling of slaves.</abstract>
