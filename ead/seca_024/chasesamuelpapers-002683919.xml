         <abstract>Collection contains letters, bills, and legal papers relating mainly to Samuel Chase Sr. and Jr. The elder Chase's documents include a legal opinion (Mar. 1787) and four bonds (1792-1806). Also included is a 1789 statement regarding the insolvency of a partnership between Thomas and John Dorsey, Luke Wheeler, and Samuel Chase. Chase had mortgaged his bed and books to help meet the partnership indebtedness of 42,000 pounds. Three other items deal with estate settlements of Chase and Phillip Barton Key. There is also legal document from Sept. 1790 pertaining to Charles Carroll of Carrollton. Finally, there is a letter by William Murdoch of London to Samuel Chase on the value of some British bank stock claimed by the state of Maryland; its value had been affected by the war between England and France.</abstract>
