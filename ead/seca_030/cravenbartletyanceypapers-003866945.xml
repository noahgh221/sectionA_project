         <abstract>Craven's Ledger, 1853-1869 (74 pp.), reveals that he was engaged in a variety of activities: blacksmithing, tailoring, farming, hauling, pottery making, and the selling of pottery, foodstuff, and other goods. He also hired labor to assist in some of this work, and entries for the payment of workers on the farm and in his pottery shop are particularly notable. The potter in his employ was Chester Webster who was listed in the 1850 census as a potter, aged 48, born in Connecticut (1850 Census, p. 38). There are a few references to business dealings in Raleigh, Fayetteville, Cedar Falls, etc. The items, 1844-1868, are mostly receipts, usually for the payment of taxes.</abstract>
