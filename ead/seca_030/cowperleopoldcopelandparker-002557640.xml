         <abstract>This collection consists of a letter of June 8, 1864, to Cowper from his niece, Sue. At the time Cowper was lieutenant governor of the Unionist government in Virginia. In addition to family news, Sue reports that the Rev. Mr. Willing, rector of a nearby Protestant Episcopal Church, was forced to resign his position with the Christian Commission. The leaders of the Commission would not allow him to serve simultaneously on the Commission and as a rector. The letter was written from Portsmouth, and Willing was a rector of St. Paul's Church.</abstract>
