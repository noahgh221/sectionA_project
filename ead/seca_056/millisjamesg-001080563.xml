         <abstract>Two oaths by John Hiatt, sworn before James G. Millis, the acting Justice of the Peace in Guilford County, North Carolina, in which John Hiatt attests to the legal status and good character of James and Lucy Pully, two free people of color. One oath reads: "he has been acquainted with James Pully a free man of color for the last ten or twelve years that he has always passed and repassed as a free person and that he believes him to be entitled to all the privileges of a free person of color"; the second affidavit reads the same, for Lucy Pully (James's wife). The oaths each include estimated ages and physical descriptions of the Pullys, along with lists of their six children: "four girls and two boys" with their names and ages. The document pertaining to James Pully also states that he "produced papers from the County of Orange certifying his freedom." The affidavits are both signed and sealed by clerk of the court J. M. Logan at the office of Greensborough, N.C.</abstract>
