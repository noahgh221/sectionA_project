         <abstract>The majority of the letters are written by Sarah Walker of Gentryville, Mo., to her daughter, Mrs. Julian J. Hollingsworth, concerning family matters centering around her sons, William Nelson Walker and George W. Walker, both of the 25th Missouri Volunteers. Seven of the letters are written from the battlefield and give details of battles and army life; four are from William Nelson and George W. Walker; one is from Joseph Hollingsworth of the 7th Indiana volunteers, 1862, August 18; and one is from Julian to his wife, 1862, July 24. There is also a letter (1857, June 15) written by John M. Smith, Eldora, Hardin Co., Iowa, to his cousin in Texas regarding his thoughts on abolition and one from George Walker, Sr., (1867, April 2) to his son-in-law, Julian.</abstract>
