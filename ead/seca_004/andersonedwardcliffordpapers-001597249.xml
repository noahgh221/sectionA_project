         <abstract>Two letters of Anderson to his wife and son in Savannah. These were written while he was in France and England on a mission for the Confederacy. He complains that all parties want to make money out of the negotiations, states that Republicans had purchased abroad 30,000 almost worthless weapons, and expresses confidence that England and France will come to the aid of the Confederacy. The other letters in the collection were also written during the Civil War. One is by a Northerner in Savannah in 1862, seeking to return to the North. He references the blockade, and quotes the price of flour and salt.</abstract>
