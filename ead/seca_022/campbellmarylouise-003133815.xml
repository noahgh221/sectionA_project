         <abstract>Diary maintained daily as a school assignment from 26 March to 30 May 1936, when Campbell was about 15 years old. Initial entries include grades and occasional teacher comments urging Campbell to include more detail. After completing the assignment, Campbell stopped the diary, picking it up again on her own initiative on 1 Jan. 1937 and continuing entries for a year. Topics include schoolwork, recreational activities (walks, bicycle rides, movies, trips to buy ice cream, reading), and family life. Campbell also included maps of her neighborhood, newspaper clippings, and other ephemera. Two legal-sized pages have been removed from the front of the volume; they hold diary entries Campbell maintained separately for 10-28 July 1934.</abstract>
