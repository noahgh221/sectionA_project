Greer notes that pneumonia, typhoid, and smallpox spread rapidly though the prison despite honest efforts of federal authorities to contain disease. The memoir was probably written after 1921. Researchers may also wish to consult the pamphlet ROLLS OF THE WASHINGTON LIGHT INFANTRY, which lists the peronnel of all three active service companies of that organization.
