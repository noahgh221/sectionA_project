Letters to William Lloyd Garrison	Garrison, William Lloyd, 1805-1879	1860-1876	1860/1876	eng	3 items	Collection includes letters to William Lloyd Garrison from Hinton Rowan Helper and Aaron Macy Powell. On June 8, 1860, Helper wrote to notify Garrison that he was sending him copies of his book, Impending Crisis of the South, to be distributed to people in the Boston area. The letter from Powell is dated February 3, 1876, and is an expression of sympathy on the death of Mrs. Garrison. Also included are a letter written by Beriah Green to William Lloyd Garrison perhaps shortly before it was published in The Liberator on Apr. 19, 1861, and a clipping from that newspaper carrying Green's letter and the editor's response to it in which he supports President Lincoln in his determination to preserve the Union. In his letter Green, a noted reformer and abolitionist, takes the position that John Brown's uprising was a legitimate protest against a morally treasonous government. He asserts that the Secessionists and the supporters of the Union are in "deadly warfare with Humanity," and that "Treason was and is the demon of Virginian Society." He asks permission to publish his remarks in Garrison's newspaper.
