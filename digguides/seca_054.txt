William Allen Gordon papers	Gordon, William Allen	1830-1847	1830/1847	eng	3 items	The first item is Scrip No. 1462, issued by the Galveston Bay and Texas Company for 4428 acres of land to Charles De Forest in New York, Oct. 16, 1830. The document carries a map showing the location of the land, which extended from the Gulf of Mexico north to about 32.5 degrees, and westward from Louisiana to the Navasota and San Jacinto Rivers. The other two items are letters to Dr. William Allen Gordon. The first was written by Capt. George Hampton Crosman on Apr. 23, 1846, at a camp near Matamoros, Mexico. He tells of the murders of Colonel Cross of his regiment, and Lt. Porter of the 4th U.S. Infantry, both of whom are believed to have been killed by Mexican bandits. He also tells of the frequent raids by Mexicans against the U.S. troops and their supplies, and complains of the apathy at headquarters about their operations and situation on the frontier, where he says they are "fairly at war." The second letter (Feb. 23, 1847) is from Capt. Abner Riviere Hetzel in Brazos Santiago, Tex. In it, he discusses preparations for Winfield Scott's Vera Cruz Expedition. He also mention the sending of the ALABAMA to Tampico, and thirty vessels leaving shortly to reinforce the batteries of General Taylor.
