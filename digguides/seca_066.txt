W. O. Hoffman exercise books	Hoffman, W. O.	about 1850-1879	1850/1879	eng	3 volumes	These three volumes are exercise books from Hoffman's studies in bookkeeping and accounting. They include a journal, daybook, and cashbook. These volumes date from about the 1870's, or perhaps somewhat later. The handwritten examples in the exercises are dated 1850's and 1870's, mostly the latter. The paper has watermarks of 1850. The covers of the volumes were printed by the Cumberland Daily News Co. According to the AMERICAN NEWSPAPER ANNUAL (1891), the CUMBERLAND DAILY NEWS was established in 1871. These facts indicate that the volumes date from the postbellum rather than the antebellum period, despite the use of paper from 1850.		Accounting -- Study and teaching| Hoffman, W.
