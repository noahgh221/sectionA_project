O. O. Howard letters	Howard, O. O. (Oliver Otis), 1830-1909	1870	1870/1870	eng	2 items	The collection consists of two letters, both written while Howard was Commissioner of the Freedmen's Bureau. The first letter (April 6, 1870) is from Brigadier-General George Williamson Balloch, Chief Disbursing Officer of the Bureau to Adelbert Ames, U.S. Senator from Miss., informing Ames that he did not need any more paid bounty agents in Miss. The second letter (June 21, 1870) is from Martin Wilson Philips to Howard. (Philips is editor-in-chief of THE SOUTHERN FARMER.) He writes on behalf of four young men in his employment. The men had purchased land with unclear titles as a result of that land having been sold under a special war tax and bought by the federal government. Most of Philips's letter, however, is devoted to his views on Reconstruction.
